import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('ch1ex1.csv') points = df.values
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans model = KMeans(n_clusters=3) model.fit(points)
labels = model.predict(points) importmatplotlib.pyplot as plt
Step 2: Assign column 0 of points to xs, and column 1 of points to ys xs = points[:,0]
              ys = points[:,1]
plt.scatter(xs, ys, c=labels) plt.show()
xs and ys
    Step 3: Make a scatter plot of
, specifying the
c=labels
keyword arguments
 to color the points by their cluster label. You'll see that KMeans has done a good job
 of identifying the clusters!
    #This is great, but let's go one step further, and add the cluster centres (the
 "centroids") to the scatter plot.
 
       Step 3: Obtain the coordinates of the centroids using the
.
centroids = model.cluster_centers_
Assign them to
 Step 4: Assign column
 centroids_y
 centroids_x = centroids[:,0] centroids_y = centroids[:,1]
 Step 5: In a single cell, create two scatter plots (this will show the two on top of one
 another). Call `plt.show()` just once, at the end.
 Firstly, the make the scatter plot you made above. Secondly, make a scatter plot of `centroids_x` and `centroids_y`, using `'X'` (a cross) as a marker by specifying the
 `marker` parameter. Set the size of the markers to be `200` using `s=200`.
 plt.scatter(xs, ys, c=labels)
 plt.scatter(centroids_x, centroids_y, marker='X', s=200)
 plt.show()
